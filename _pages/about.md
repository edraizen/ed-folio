I am a PhD Candidate in [Phil Bourne's lab](https://bournelab.org) in the University of Virginia Department of Biomedical Engineering. I am fascinated by protein structure, machine Learning, evolution, protein-protein interactions and parisitology. 

I am currrenly looking for industry or postdocs postions at the intersection of structural biology and deep learning.

Previously, I was an ML intern @ [VantAI](https://www.vant.ai/) as well as worked in the labs of [Anna Panchenko](https://panchenko-lab.org/), [Debbie Marks](https://www.deboramarkslab.com/), [Mark Blaxter](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/blaxter-mark/), [Dietlind Gerloff](http://www.ffame.org/dgerloff.php) and [Paul Adams](http://cci.lbl.gov/~paul/).
