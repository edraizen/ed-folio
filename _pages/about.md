I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar in [Andrej Sali's lab](https://salilab.org) at the University of California, San Francisco in the Department of Bioengineering and Therapuetic Sciences. I am fascinated by protein structure, machine Learning, evolution, protein-protein interactions and parisitology. 

Previously, I completed my PhD in [Phil Bourne's lab](https://bournelab.org) in the University of Virginia and was an ML intern @ [VantAI](https://www.vant.ai/). Prior to my PhD, I worked in the labs of [Anna Panchenko](https://panchenko-lab.org/), [Debbie Marks](https://www.deboramarkslab.com/), [Mark Blaxter](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/blaxter-mark/), [Dietlind Gerloff](http://www.ffame.org/dgerloff.php) and [Paul Adams](http://cci.lbl.gov/~paul/).

Outside of the lab you can find me drumming for [Orange Folder](https://orangefolder.bandcamp.com/album/orange-folder), booking DIY concerts at [Chinchilla Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/chinchilla_cafe_cville/?hl=en) and bikepacking. I am also a proud member and organizer for [UAW 5810](https://uaw5810.org/), the union for postdocs and academic researchers.
